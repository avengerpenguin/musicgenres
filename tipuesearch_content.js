The term a cappella was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato musical styles. In the 19th century, a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony, coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists, led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.

Initially intended for creating basslines, this machine inadvertently birthed the genre's signature squelchy and otherworldly sound, akin to a musical acid trip. Acid House isn't merely a genre; it's a cultural phenomenon that challenged conventions and brought forth a new era of electronic music. Its squelchy basslines and mind-bending sounds captured the imagination of a generation and continue to influence artists across genres today. Acid House's legacy extends far beyond its sonic impact, as it catalyzed a subculture that championed unity, inclusivity, and the pursuit of ecstatic experiences.

These squelchy, resonant, and often unpredictable sequences became the genre's sonic identity. Repetitive Patterns: Acid House tracks are known for their hypnotic repetition, creating a trance-like state that draws listeners into a deep, rhythmic groove. 4/4 Beats: Like its predecessors in the dance music world, Acid House retains the driving 4/4 beat, encouraging dance and movement. Psychedelic Aesthetics: Both the music and the culture surrounding Acid House are characterized by their psychedelic influences, visually and sonically. Revolution of Raves: Acid House parties and raves played a crucial role in the genre's cultural impact, fostering a sense of community, rebellion, and uninhibited expression. Artists and Tracks Phuture - \"Acid Tracks\": Widely considered the first Acid House track, Phuture's \"Acid Tracks\" (1987) introduced the world to the TB -303's hypnotic potential. Josh Wink - \"Higher State of Consciousness\": Released in the 1990s, this track captured the essence of Acid House's mind-altering journey, blending acid squelches with pulsating beats. 808 State - \"Pacific State\": While not as intense as other Acid House tracks, \"Pacific State\" (1989) by 808 State infuses the genre's energy with a mellow, dreamy atmosphere. The KLF - \"What Time Is Love?\": The KLF 's fusion of Acid House with pop sensibilities in \"What Time Is Love?\" (1988) exemplified the genre's versatility. Hardfloor - \"Acperience 1\": Known for their innovative approach to Acid House, Hardfloor's \"Acperience 1\" (1992) pushed the boundaries of the genre's sonic palette. Armando - \"100% of Disin' You\": Armando's track (1988) is an exhilarating journey through the Acid House landscape, showcasing the raw energy and intensity of the genre.

Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads from the African-American culture. The blues form is ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll, and is characterized by the call-and-response pattern (the blues scale and specific chord progressions) of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \"worried notes\"), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound.

The genre features a distinctive record production style, drum machine-backed rhythms, pitch corrected vocals, and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Electronic influences are becoming an increasing trend and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B vocalists often use melisma, and since the mid-1980s, R&B rhythms have been combined with elements of hip hop culture and music and pop culture and pop music.

It features vocal group harmony that carries an engaging melodic line to a simple beat with little or no instrumentation. Lyrics are simple, usually about love, sung by a lead vocal over background vocals, and often featuring, in the bridge, a melodramatically heartfelt recitative addressed to the beloved.

The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal. During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands such as Witchfinder General and Pagan Altar from England, American bands Pentagram, Saint Vitus, the Obsessed, Trouble, and Cirith Ungol, and Swedish band Candlemass defined doom metal as a distinct genre.

Pure electronic instruments depended entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an electronic oscillator, theremin, or synthesizer. Electromechanical instruments can have mechanical parts such as strings, hammers, and electric elements including magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Such electromechanical devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and the electric guitar.

Funk typically consists of a complex percussive groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that create a \"hypnotic\" and \"danceable\" feel.

Developed by inner-city African Americans, Latino Americans, and Caribbean Americans, it consists of stylized rhythmic music (usually built around drum beats) that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing.

Although short-lived, pub rock was live rock played in small traditional venues like pubs and clubs. Since major labels showed no interest in pub rock groups, pub rockers sought out independent record labels such as Stiff Records.

It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music. Rock also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar, drums, and one or more singers.

It dates back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered \"classic\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll. The term \"rockabilly\" itself is a portmanteau of \"rock\" (from \"rock ‘n' roll\") and \"hillbilly\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \"hillbilly music\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie-woogie, jump blues, and electric blues.

Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, known as the swing era. The verb \"to swing\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive.
