Post-progressive is a type of rock music distinguished from vintage progressive rock styles, specifically 1970s prog. Post-progressive draws upon newer developments in popular music and the avant-garde since the mid-1970s. It especially draws from ethnic music and minimalism, elements which were new to rock music. It is different from neo-progressive rock in that the latter pastiches 1970s prog, while "post-progressive" identifies progressive rock music that stems from sources other than prog.
