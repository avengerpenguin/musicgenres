Country (also called country and western) is a genre of popular music that originated with blues, church music such as Southern gospel and spirituals, old-time, and American folk music forms including Appalachian, Cajun, Creole, Hawaiian, and the cowboy Western music styles of New Mexico, Red Dirt, Tejano, and Texas country.
