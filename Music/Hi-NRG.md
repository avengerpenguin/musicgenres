Emerging in the late 1970s and reaching its peak during the 1980s, Hi-NRG (High Energy) is a genre that evolved from the disco era. It incorporated the driving rhythm and pulsating beats of disco music but introduced a faster tempo and more intense electronic elements. Hi-NRG's lively and energetic nature made it an instant hit within dance clubs, where its infectious grooves encouraged frenetic movement and exhilarating dance routines.
