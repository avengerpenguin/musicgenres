---

Emerging from the warehouses and clubs of Chicago and later making its way across the Atlantic to the UK, Acid House (also sometimes just called "Acid") originated from the experimentation with the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. Initially intended for creating basslines, this machine inadvertently birthed the genre's signature squelchy and otherworldly sound, akin to a musical acid trip.

Acid House isn't merely a genre; it's a cultural phenomenon that challenged conventions and brought forth a new era of electronic music. Its squelchy basslines and mind-bending sounds captured the imagination of a generation and continue to influence artists across genres today. Acid House's legacy extends far beyond its sonic impact, as it catalyzed a subculture that championed unity, inclusivity, and the pursuit of ecstatic experiences. As you delve into the world of Acid House, be prepared to embark on a sonic journey that transcends time and space.
