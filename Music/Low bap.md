Low bap is a subgenre of the Greek hip hop music scene that emerged in the mid-1990s as the sound of the prominent Greek hip hop group Active Member. It is characterized by slower tempo and rapping than usual, often combined with lyrics with sociopolitical content. The words "low bap" do not have a specific meaning; they merely represent a perspective on life, society and politics that people in the movement have. The low bap movement has been expanded, so that today it includes bookstores, youth centers and specialized magazines. Cinematic attempts, concerts, and festivals have also taken place in an effort to broaden the scope of the movement, and introduce new bands to the genre's range of followers.
