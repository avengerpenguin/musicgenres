No wave is a music genre, named for the transient avant-garde music and visual art scene from which it emerged in the late 1970s in downtown New York City. The term "no wave" was a pun based on the rejection of commercial new wave music. Reacting against punk rock's recycling of rock and roll clich√©s, no wave musicians instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock genres like free jazz and disco while often reflecting an abrasive, confrontational, and nihilistic worldview.
